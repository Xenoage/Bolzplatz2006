## About

The source code and other material of the game (including the "Gold Edition" and the website sources) were copied from [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bp2k6/) to this repository, mainly for archiving.
There are also efforts to reactivate the project and improve the game, like in [hoehnp's fork](https://github.com/hoehnp/Bolzplatz2006).
