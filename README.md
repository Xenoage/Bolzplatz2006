# Bolzplatz 2006

_The funny football game in 3D-comic-style, published in 2006_


The source code and other material of the game (including the "Gold Edition" and the [website](https://www.bolzplatz2006.de) sources) were copied from [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bp2k6/) to this repository, mainly for archiving.
There are also efforts to reactivate the project and improve the game, like in [hoehnp's fork](https://github.com/hoehnp/Bolzplatz2006).

If you have any quesions, please get in touch with info@xenoage.com
