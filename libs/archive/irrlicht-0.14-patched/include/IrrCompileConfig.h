_IRR_COMPILE_WITH_DX9_DEV_PACK_. So you simply need to add something like this
to the compiler settings: -DIRR_COMPILE_WITH_DX9_DEV_PACK

into a temporary file at runtime for this purpose. To debug your shaders, choose  
Debug->Direct3D->StartWithDirect3DDebugging in Visual Studio, and for every shader a
file named 'irr_dbg_shader_%%.vsh' or 'irr_dbg_shader_%%.psh' will be created. Drag'n'drop
the file you want to debug into visual studio. That's it. You can now set breakpoints and
watch registers, variables etc. This works with ASM, HLSL, and both with pixel and vertex shaders.
