	//! Abstracted and easy to use fixed function/programmable pipeline material modes.
	enum E_MATERIAL_TYPE
	{
		//! Standard solid material. Only first texture is used, which is
		//! supposed to be the diffuse material.
		EMT_SOLID = 0,

		//! Solid material with 2 texture layers. The second is blended onto the
		//! first using the alpha value of the vertex colors.
		//! This material is currently not implemented in OpenGL, but it
		//! works with DirectX.
		EMT_SOLID_2_LAYER,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique:
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP,

		//! Material type with lightmap technique like EMT_LIGHTMAP, but
		//! lightmap and diffuse texture are not modulated, but added instead.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_ADD,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique:
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		//! The texture colors are effectively multiplyied by 2 for brightening.
		//! like known in DirectX as D3DTOP_MODULATE2X.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_M2,

		//! Material type with standard lightmap technique:
		//! There should be 2 textures: The first texture layer is a diffuse map,
		//! the second is a light map. Vertex light is ignored.
		//! The texture colors are effectively multiplyied by 4 for brightening.
		//! like known in DirectX as D3DTOP_MODULATE4X.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_M4,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP_M2, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M2,

		//! Like EMT_LIGHTMAP_4, but also supports dynamic lighting.
		EMT_LIGHTMAP_LIGHTING_M4,

		//! Detail mapped material. The first texture is diffuse color map, the
		//! second is added to this and usually displayed with a bigger scale value
		//! so that it adds more detail. The detail map is added to the diffuse map using
		//! ADD_SIGNED, so that it is possible to add and substract color from the diffuse
		//! map. For example a value of (127,127,127) will not change the appearance of
		//! the diffuse map at all.
		//! Often used for terrain rendering.
		EMT_DETAIL_MAP,

		//! Makes the material look like it was reflection the environment
		//! around it. To make this possible, a texture called 'sphere map'
		//! is used, which must be set as Texture1.
		EMT_SPHERE_MAP,

		//! A reflecting material with an
		//! optional additional non reflecting texture layer. The reflection
		//! map should be set as Texture 1.
		EMT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER,

		//! A transparent material. Only the first texture is used.
		//! The new color is calculated by simply adding the source color and
		//! the dest color. This means if for example a billboard using a texture with
		//! black background and a red circle on it is drawn with this material, the
		//! result is that only the red circle will be drawn a little bit transparent,
		//! and everything which was black is 100% transparent and not visible.
		//! This material type is useful for e.g. particle effects.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR,

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the texture alpha channel.
		//! The final color is blended together from the destination color and the
		//! texture color, using the alpha channel value as blend factor.
		//! Only first texture is used. If you are using this material with small
		//! textures, it is a good idea to load the texture in 32 bit
		//! mode (video::IVideoDriver::setTextureCreationFlag()).
		//! Also, an alpha ref is used, which can be manipulated using SMaterial::MaterialTypeParam.
		//! If set to 0, the alpha ref gets its default value which is 0.5f and which means
		//! that pixels with an alpha value >127 will be written, others not.  In other, simple
		//! words: this value controls how sharp the edges become when going from a
		//! transparent to a solid spot on the texture.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL,

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the texture alpha channel.
		//! If the alpha channel value is greater than 127, a pixel is written to the
		//! target, otherwise not. This material does not use alpha blending
		//! and is a lot faster than EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL. It
		//! is ideal for drawing stuff like leafes of plants, because the borders
		//! are not blurry but sharp.
		//! Only first texture is used. If you are using this material with small
		//! textures and 3d object, it is a good idea to load the texture in 32 bit
		//! mode (video::IVideoDriver::setTextureCreationFlag()).
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_ALPHA_CHANNEL_REF,

		//! Makes the material transparent based on the vertex alpha value.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA,

		//! A transparent reflecting material with an
		//! optional additional non reflecting texture layer. The reflection
		//! map should be set as Texture 1. The transparency depends on the
		//! alpha value in the vertex colors. A texture which will not reflect
		//! can be set als Texture 2.
		//! Please note that this material type is currently not 100% implemented
		//! in OpenGL. It works in Direct3D.
		EMT_TRANSPARENT_REFLECTION_2_LAYER,

		//! A solid normal map renderer. First texture is the color map, the
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
		//! IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents() (See SpecialFX2 Tutorial).
		//! This shader runs on vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.1 capable hardware and
		//! falls back on a fixed function lighted material if this hardware is not available.
		//! Only two lights are supported by this shader, if there are more, the nearest two
		//! are chosen. Currently, this shader is only implemented for the D3D8 and D3D9 renderers.
		EMT_NORMAL_MAP_SOLID,

		//! A transparent normal map renderer. First texture is the color map, the
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
		//! IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents() (See SpecialFX2 Tutorial).
		//! This shader runs on vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.1 capable hardware and
		//! falls back on a fixed function lighted material if this hardware is not available.
		//! Only two lights are supported by this shader, if there are more, the nearest two
		//! are chosen. Currently, this shader is only implemented for the D3D8 and D3D9 renderers.
		EMT_NORMAL_MAP_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR,

		//! A transparent (based on the vertex alpha value) normal map renderer.
		//! First texture is the color map, the
		//! second should be the normal map. Note that you should use this material
		//! only when drawing geometry consisting of vertices of type S3DVertexTangents
		//! (EVT_TANGENTS). You can convert any mesh into this format using
		//! IMeshManipulator::createMeshWithTangents() (See SpecialFX2 Tutorial).
		//! This shader runs on vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.1 capable hardware and
		//! falls back on a fixed function lighted material if this hardware is not available.
		//! Only two lights are supported by this shader, if there are more, the nearest two
		//! are chosen. Currently, this shader is only implemented for the D3D8 and D3D9 renderers.
		EMT_NORMAL_MAP_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA,

		//! Just like EMT_NORMAL_MAP_SOLID, but uses parallax mapping too, which
		//! looks a lot more realistic. This only works when the hardware supports at
		//! least vertex shader 1.1 and pixel shader 1.4.
		//! First texture is the color map, the  second should be the normal map.
		//! The normal map texture should contain the height value in the
		//! alpha component. The IVideoDriver::makeNormalMapTexture() method writes
		//! this value automaticly when creating normal maps from a heightmap when using a 32 bit
		//! texture.
		//! The height scale of the material (affecting the bumpiness) is being controlled
		//! by the SMaterial::MaterialTypeParam member.
		//! If set to zero, the default value (0.02f) will be applied. Otherwise
		//! the value set in SMaterial::MaterialTypeParam is taken. This value depends on with which
		//! scale the texture is mapped on the material. Too high or low values of MaterialTypeParam
		//! can result in strange artifacts.
		EMT_PARALLAX_MAP_SOLID,

		//! A material just like EMT_PARALLAX_MAP_SOLID, but it is transparent, using
		//! EMT_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR as base material.
		EMT_PARALLAX_MAP_TRANSPARENT_ADD_COLOR,

		//! A material just like EMT_PARALLAX_MAP_SOLID, but it is transparent, using
		//! EMT_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA as base material.
		EMT_PARALLAX_MAP_TRANSPARENT_VERTEX_ALPHA,

		//! This value is not used. It only forces this enumeration to compile in 32 bit.
		EMT_FORCE_32BIT = 0x7fffffff
