//! A particle system scene node for creating snow, fire, exlosions, smoke...
/** A scene node controlling a particle System. The behavior of the particles
can be controlling by setting the right particle emitters and effectors.
You can for example easily a campfire by doing this:

\code
	scene::IParticleSystemSceneNode* p = scenemgr->addParticleSystemSceneNode();
	p->setParticleSize(core::dimension2d<f32>(20.0f, 10.0f));
	scene::IParticleEmitter* em = p->createBoxEmitter(
		core::aabbox3d<f32>(-5,0,-5,5,1,5), 
		core::vector3df(0.0f,0.03f,0.0f),
		40,80, video::SColor(0,255,255,255),video::SColor(0,255,255,255), 1100,2000);
	p->setEmitter(em);
	em->drop();
	scene::IParticleAffector* paf = p->createFadeOutParticleAffector();
	p->addAffector(paf);
	paf->drop();
\endcode
