Before running the Makefile, you should download and extract the iirlicht-engine.

Once this is done, correct the Makefile to point at the location where you extracted the source.

After that, you should be able to run the command

make

And everything should be build... If you have trouble building, 
please use the sourceforge.net forum for this project, it can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=112018


Have Fun !
