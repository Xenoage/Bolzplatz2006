   * <p>
   * <b>Remarks
   * FMOD has a sample management system that holds onto any samples loaded or allocated, and frees them all when you call FSOUND_Close. 
   * It takes the hassle out of having to keep hold of a lot of sample handles and remember to free them all at the end of your application.
   * It is basically an expandle array of handles that holds each sample until FMOD closes down where it does a cleanup. 
   * FSOUND_UNMANAGED can be used so FMOD does NOT use the sample management system. You have to make sure they are freed yourself.
   * --------
   * Specify FSOUND_LOADMEMORY to load a file from a memory image. 
   * The pointer you pass to name must be the actual image of the data you want to load.
   * The length parameter is to be filled out if FSOUND_LOADMEMORY is specified, otherwise if you do not specify memory loading, can be safely ignored and should be set to 0.
   * --------
   * Compressed formats are expanded into memory. If the file is quite large, it could take a while to load.
   * --------
   * If FSOUND_8BITS is specified and the file decodes to 16bit normally, FMOD will downgrade the sample to 8bit.

   * Sets the minimum and maximum audible distance for a sample.
   * MinDistance is the minimum distance that the sound emitter will cease to continue growing 
   * louder at (as it approaches the listener). Within the mindistance it stays at the constant loudest volume possible. Outside of this mindistance it begins to attenuate.
   * MaxDistance is the distance a sound stops attenuating at. Beyond this point it will stay at the volume it would be at maxdistance units from the listener and will not attenuate any more.
   * MinDistance is useful to give the impression that the sound is loud or soft in 3d space. An example of this is a small quiet object, such as a bumblebee, which you could set a mindistance of to 0.1 for example, which would cause it to attenuate quickly and dissapear when only a few meters away from the listener.
   * Another example is a jumbo jet, which you could set to a mindistance of 100.0, which would keep the sound volume at max until the listener was 100 meters away, then it would be hundreds of meters more before it would fade out.
   * -------
   * In summary, increase the mindistance of a sound to make it 'louder' in a 3d world, and 
   * decrease it to make it 'quieter' in a 3d world.
   * maxdistance is effectively obsolete unless you need the sound to stop fading out at a certain point. Do not adjust this from the default if you dont need to.

   * Sets the minimum and maximum audible distance for a channel.

   * MaxDistance is the distance a sound stops attenuating at. Beyond this point it will stay at the volume it would be at maxdistance units from the listener and will not attenuate any more.
   * MinDistance is useful to give the impression that the sound is loud or soft in 3d space. An example of this is a small quiet object, such as a bumblebee, which you could set a mindistance of to 0.1 for example, which would cause it to attenuate quickly and dissapear when only a few meters away from the listener.

   * Opens an audio file/url/cd ready for streaming. 
   * This opens the file in preparation for playback in real-time, without needing to decode the whole file into memory first
   * <p>
   * <b>Remarks</b>
   * WAV support supports windows codec compressed WAV files.
   * --------------
   * FSOUND_MPEGACCURATE is to be used cautiously. To open a file with this mode turned on, it has to scan the whole MP3 first. This can take several seconds if the file is big, or the harddisk/cpu is slow.
   * A way to speed up this process would be to load the compressed mp3 into memory first, and use the FSOUND_LOADMEMORY flag with this function.
   * --------------
   * NOTE : Internet stream limitations
   * - URLs must start with "http://".
   * - The only supported formats for HTTP streams are MP3 (must have .mp3 extension) and OggVorbis (must have .ogg extension).
   * --------------
   * FSB streaming is not supported if the format from FSBank is 'Retain original format'. On PC platforms, only PCM and ADPCM FSB files are allowed.
   * --------------
   * Note, on PlayStation 2 you cannot use FSOUND_LOADMEMORY, you may use FSOUND_LOADMEMORYIOP though.
   * --------------
   * When opening with the FSOUND_NONBLOCKING flag, this function always succeeds at the point of being called. 
   * It will always return a valid channel handle, even though the file might fail to open. To determine any error in non blocking mode use FSOUND_Stream_GetOpenState.
   * --------------
   * NOTE: CDDA Streaming (Win32 only!)
   * To open a CD for CDDA streaming, specify the drive letter of a CD drive e.g. FSOUND_Stream_Open("d:", 0, 0, 0); FSOUND_Stream_Open will create a stream with multiple substreams, one for each CD track. Use FSOUND_Stream_SetSubStream to select which CD track to play.
   * A number of options can be passed to FSOUND_Stream_Open along with the drive letter. They are :
   * ? e.g. FSOUND_Stream_Open("d:*?", 0, 0, 0); This option will cause a tag field called "CD_DEVICE_INFO" to be attached to the stream. This tag field contains information on the specified CD device.
   * ! e.g. FSOUND_Stream_Open("d:*!", 0, 0, 0); This option will cause the stream to be opened in "quick open" mode. When a stream is opened in this mode, calls to FSOUND_Stream_SetSubStream will return immediately making it quick to select each substream in turn and get the length of each CD track. Note that a stream in quick open mode cannot be played! Use quick open mode to get track lengths and then re-open the stream without quick open mode to actually play it.
   * j e.g. FSOUND_Stream_Open("d:*j", 0, 0, 0); This option turns jitter correction OFF.
   * Options can be combined like so: FSOUND_Stream_Open("d:*?!j", 0, 0, 0);
   * If a nonblocking CDDA stream fails to open, a tag field called "CD_ERROR" will be attached to the stream. This tag field contains a textual description of why the stream failed to open.
   * NOTE: FMOD will always try to use native NTSCSI support to communicate with CD devices before trying to use ASPI. If FMOD is using ASPI then it can only access the first CD device it finds.

   * Also added is the ability to associate the stream channel to a specified DSP unit. This allows

   * between these 'groups', and allow various things like having one group affected by reverb (wet mix) and another group of 
   * channels unaffected (dry). This is useful to seperate things like music from being affected
   * by DSP effects, while other sound effects are.
   * <p>
   * <b>Remarks</b>

   * --------
   * FSOUND_STEREOPAN is recommended for stereo streams if you call FSOUND_SetPan. This puts the left and right channel to full volume.

   * Creates a DSP unit, and places it in the DSP chain position specified by the priority

   * DSP units are freed with FSOUND_DSP_Free
   * <p>
   * <b>Remarks</b>
   * A dsp unit is NOT ACTIVE by default. You have to activate it with FSOUND_DSP_SetActive
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Priorities and default system units.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * A note on priorities. FSOUND processes DSP units in order of priority. A 0 priority
   * unit gets processed first, a 1 priority unit gets processed next, and so on. 
   * FSOUND actually uses these DSP units to mix its sound effects and music! Yes, you have
   * access to them (be careful!). It is possible to totally remove, replace or deactivate 
   * all of FSOUND's system units so that it does nothing at all!
   * FSOUND has preinstalled default system units at the following priority locations:
   * FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_CLEARUNIT (priority 0) - Clear Unit. This unit clears out 
   * the mixbuffer for the next units to mix into. You can disable this unit and replace
   * it with something other than a clearer, such as a scaler, which fades down the mix
   * buffer instead of clearing it, to produce a very rough echo effect.
   * FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_SFXUNIT (priority 100) - SFX Unit. This unit mixes sound 
   * effect channels into the mix buffer, which was previously cleared with the Clear 
   * Unit. 
   * FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_MUSICUNIT (priority 200) - Music Unit. This unit mixes all 
   * music channels into the mix buffer, which was previously mixed into with the SFX 
   * Unit. 
   * FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_CLIPANDCOPYUNIT (priority 1000) - Clip and Copy Unit. This 
   * unit takes the finally mixed buffer, and clips it to the output stream size (if it
   * needs to), and then sends it off to the sound device. It is done last. If this is
   * disabled you will hear no sound.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Buffer Lengths.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * The 'length' value of the DSP callback is roughly 20ms worth of data.
   * Use FSOUND_DSP_GetBufferLength to get the exact callback length.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Buffer Widths
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Remember that FSOUND uses different buffer types depending on what type of mixer it is.
   * You will have to compensate for this by writing different routines depending on the 
   * mixer type (ie mmx or non mmx), just like FSOUND does. 
   * Currently there are the 3 types of mixers and their buffer sizes.
   * You can get the type of mixer being used by calling the FSOUND_GetMixer function.
   * You may want to check on this inside your callback, or set up a function pointer system,
   * whatever you think is suitable (it costs nothing to do a FSOUND_GetMixer every time).
   * - FSOUND_MIXER_BLENDMODE : This buffer is a stereo, signed 32bit buffer (8 bytes per 
   * sample). The data is in integer format.
   * Data written to this buffer is not clipped and passed to the output stream until the 
   * very end of the chain (the clip and copy unit). For this type of mixer, you dont 
   * have to worry about clipping becuase FSOUND does this for you.
   * - FSOUND_MIXER_QUALITY_FPU / FSOUND_MIXER_QUALITY_FPU_VOLUMERAMP: This buffer is also a 
   * stereo, signed 32bit buffer (8 bytes per sample). This data is in floating point 
   * format.
   * The same clip and copy rules apply here as for the above mixer.
   * - Any MMX based mixer : This buffer is a stereo, signed 16bit buffer (4 bytes per sample).
   * When writing to this buffer, you must make sure the result does not overflow this 
   * signed 16bit range.
   * If you add data into to this buffer, make sure it is clipped to a signed 16bit range
   * before writing it back. FSOUND only copies this data to the output stream, it does
   * not clip it.
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Speed
   * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * DSP Units are processed then and there, inside the mixing routine. Remember to make
   * your process as FAST as possible, or the output device's play cursor will catch up to
   * FSOUND's write cursor while your routine takes its time to complete, and make it start 
   * to break up. 
   * So basically, if it isnt fast, then FSOUND will not be able to send the data to the
   * output device in time for the next mixer update, and the result will be corrupted sound.
   * FSOUND_DSP_MixBuffers is available now, so if you need to mix some raw data into the output 
   * buffer quickly, you can use FSOUND's own optimized mixer directly to do it!
   * Finally, you can see how your routine affects cpu usage, by using FSOUND_GetCPUUsage.
   * The cpu usage returned by this function includes any time spent in DSP units as well.
   * (this function times everything). If you are really bored, you can see how much FSOUND's
   * system units take cpu-wise, by turning them on and off and seeing how they affect 
   * performance.
   * </p>
   * @param callbackHandler This is a reference to your DSP Unit callback, of type FSOUND_DSPCALLBACK.
   * The prototype for a callback is declared in the following fashion.
   * Callbacks must return a pointer to the buffer you work on, so that
   * the next dsp unit can work on it. 
   * See the definition of FSOUND_DSPCALLBACK for more.
