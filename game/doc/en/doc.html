<span class="head"><b>Welcome to Slam Soccer 2006!</b></span><br><br>

This short tutorial helps you to learn the most important things about Slam Soccer 2006. If you have further questions or problems, then visit our forum at: <a href="http://www.xenoage.com/bp2k6/en/forum.php">http://www.xenoage.com/bp2k6/en/forum.php</a>

<span class="head"><b>Game Modes</b></span><br><br>


<b>Friendly Game</b><br><br>
If you just want to play a match, this is the right mode for you. You can play against the computer or against a human opponent, or you can even watch a computer-vs-computer match. Before the match starts, you have to select the two teams (both football clubs and national teams are possible, you can choose between more than 80 teams!), a stadium, the weather and the referee. Then the match starts.<br><br>

<b>World Cup</b><br><br>
In this game mode you can play the football World Cup 2006. Choose one of the 32 national teams and first play the 3 group matches. If you place first or second, you are qualified for the round of sixteen. If you win the final of the World Cup, you can register in the online hall-of-fame on our website.<br><br>

<b>Career</b><br><br>
This is the game mode for real football enthusiasts. Start with a team of your choice, but start from scratch. You play in the shabby "village league" and have a small and muddy stadium, but you can improve your situation step for step. You get money for won matches and good marketing, and you can invest into your stadium and build new stands and attractions. With some mean tricks you can make it a little bit easier... But the most decisive thing is your sportive success, and that means: Champion of the premium league! If zou even win the international Allstars League, zou can register in the hall-of-fame on our website.<br><br><br>



<span class="head"><b>Multiplayer</b></span><br><br>


Nothing is more fun than to play again a human opponent, that's why we integrated a multiplayer mode in Slam Soccer 2006. To make things easy, both players sit in front of the same screen and computer. Ideally two gamepads are used (Slam Soccer 2006 finds them automatically, if they are correctly installed in your operating system), but you can also play with one gamepad and the keyboard, or even both players with the keyboard.

<span class="head"><b>The Matches</b></span><br><br>


Let's now talk about the most important part of this game: the football matches! We have tried to keep the control as simple as possible. The following paragraph describes the default configuration, but you can change it in the "settings" menu as you like.<br><br>

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
  <tr><td><b>Player 1</b></th><td><b>Keyboard</b></td><td><b>Gamepad</b></td></tr></tr>
  <tr><td>Run left</td><td>Arrow key left</td><td>Left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run up</td><td>Arrow key up</td><td>Up</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run right</td><td>Arrow key right</td><td>Right</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run down</td><td>Arrow key down</td><td>Down</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Pass, without ball: tackle</td><td>L</td><td>Button 1</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Shoot, without ball: player change</td><td>K</td><td>Button 3</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Sprint</td><td>J</td><td>Button 2</td></tr>
  <tr><td><br></td></tr>

  <tr><td>Run left</td><td>F</td><td>F</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Run up</td><td>T</td><td>T</td></tr>
